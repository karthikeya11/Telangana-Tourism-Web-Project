<i> The Jogulamba temple is regarded as a Shakti Peetha where Sati Devi's upper teeth fell. The mythology of Daksha yagna and Sati's self immolation is the origin story
of Shakti Peethas. The original temple was grounded by Muslim invaders in 1390 CE. The temple was rebuilt after 615 years.
Shakti Peethas are shrines which are the most divine seats of the Mother Goddess. The body parts of the corpse of Sati Devi had fallen in these places, when Lord Shiva carried it and wandered throughout Aryavartha in sorrow.</i><br>
