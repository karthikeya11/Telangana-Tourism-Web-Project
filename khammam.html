<h1><u> BOGATHA WATERFALLS</u></h1>
<p><i>Bogatha Waterfall is a waterfall located on the Cheekupally stream, Wazeedu Mandal, Mulugu district, Telangana. It is located 120 kilometers from Bhadrachalam, 90 kilometers from Mulugu, 140km away from Warangal and 329 kilometers from Hyderabad. The newly constructed Eturnagaram bridge on National Highway 163 reduced the travelling distance to 329km from 440km. </p></i>
<h2><u> TOURISM </u></h2>
<i>Even though water flows throughout the year, a good time to visit is between June and November (after the monsoon), when the most water flows. There is no road facility, so visitors have to trek for some distance to reach the waterfall.

Bogatha is colloquially called as "the Telangana Niagara" and "Telangana Niagara jalapatham". its a nice scenery to go and visit there is a well maintained park and tower to see around
