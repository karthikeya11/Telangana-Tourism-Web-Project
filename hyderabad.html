<h1><u> GOLCONDA FORT </u></h1>
<p><i> Golconda Fort (also known as Golla konda (Telugu: "shepherds' hill"), (Urdu: “round hill”), is a fortified citadel built by the Qutb Shahi dynasty (c. 1512–1687), located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially Kollur Mine, Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds, known as the Golconda Diamonds</p></i>
<h2><u> HISTORY </u></h2>
<i>Bahamani rulers took possession of the Hill to make a fort. Under the Bahmani Sultanate, Golconda slowly rose to prominence. Sultan Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk (r. 1487–1543), sent by the Bahmanids as a governor at Golconda, established the city as the seat of his government around 1501. Bahmani rule gradually weakened during this period, and Sultan Quli (Quli Qutub Shah period) formally became independent in 1538, establishing the Qutb Shahi dynasty based in Golconda.</i>
